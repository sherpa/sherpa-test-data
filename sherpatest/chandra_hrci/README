Example Chandra HRC-I (imaging mode) spectrum and response

This data was retrieved from the development version of version 2.1 of
the Chandra Source Catalog. It is only used to check we can read the
data in correctly, so the fact that it may change slightly by the time
the CSC 2.1 release is finalized is not really an issue. Hopefully.

It was added for issue https://github.com/sherpa/sherpa/issues/1830
